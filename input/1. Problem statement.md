### 1. Problem Statement:

#### **Objective**:  
Develop a machine learning model to predict heat island hotspots in urban areas, specifically in the Bronx and Manhattan regions of New York City. The model should also identify key factors contributing to the formation of these hotspots.

#### **Target Variables**:  
- Near-surface air temperature data collected on **24 July 2021** using a ground traverse.  
- Data includes **traverse points** (latitude and longitude) and corresponding **UHI Index values**.  

#### **Task**:  
- Build a **regression model** to predict UHI Index values for given locations.  
- Highlight the **key factors** that significantly contribute to the development of urban heat islands.  

#### **Challenge Timeline**:  
- **Start Date**: January 20, 2025  
- **End Date**: March 20, 2025  

#### **Key Focus**:  
- Understanding the relationship between urban features and heat island intensity.  
- Using the UHI Index as a metric to assess relative temperature differences across urban zones.  

This challenge aims to leverage data science to address urban heat island effects, providing insights for better urban planning and heat mitigation strategies.
