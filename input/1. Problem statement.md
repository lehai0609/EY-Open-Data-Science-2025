### **Summary of the 2025 EY Open Science AI & Data Challenge Participant Guidance**

#### **Objective**
The challenge aims to develop an AI-driven digital model to predict the locations and severity of the **Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect** in urban areas. The goal is to provide insights into the drivers of urban heating and create practical solutions for urban planners and decision-makers to mitigate heat-related issues. The challenge also emphasizes increasing awareness of the UHI phenomenon and enabling global scalability of solutions.

#### **Data Inputs**
Participants will use multiple datasets to develop machine learning models, including:
- **Ground-Level Air Temperature Data:** Collected on **July 24, 2021**, by **CAPA Strategies** using automobile traverses across **New York City (Bronx and Manhattan)**, with **11,229 data points**.
- **Building Footprint Data:** Represents urban density, which influences heat retention and airflow.
- **Satellite Data:**
  - **Sentinel-2 Optical Data (Multispectral, 10m resolution, 5-day revisit)**: Provides vegetation, water proximity, and urban density information.
  - **Landsat Land Surface Temperature (LST, 100m resolution, 8-day revisit)**: Measures surface temperature variations.
- **Local Weather Data:** Includes temperature, humidity, wind speed/direction, and solar flux from the **New York State Mesonet**.

Participants can also incorporate additional **open-source datasets** to enhance model performance.

#### **Constraints**
- The model must be **open-source** and designed to run on **common computing resources** (e.g., 4 cores, 32GB RAM) or **cloud environments** (Azure, Google Cloud, or GitHub Codespaces).
- Data preprocessing must account for **time synchronization** (e.g., Landsat data collected at **11:30 AM**, while ground data was collected at **3:00 PM - 4:00 PM**).
- Cloud cover may impact **Sentinel-2 data**, requiring filtering or interpolation.
- The **UHI Index** is calculated relative to the city's mean temperature, meaning the model should focus on variations rather than absolute temperatures.

#### **Evaluation Criteria**
1. **Model Performance (Phase 1)**
   - Models will be ranked based on accuracy using the **R-squared** metric.
   - The **top 10 semi-finalists** will be selected based on the highest scores.
   - Additional datasets, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning may improve performance.

2. **Business Plan (Phase 2)**
   - The **top 5 finalists** will develop a **4-page report** and a **5-minute video** demonstrating:
     - Practical applications for city planners.
     - Scalability to other cities.
     - Potential socioeconomic impacts on vulnerable communities.
     - Integration with additional datasets for enhanced accuracy.
   - Innovation, compliance, and efficiency will also be assessed.

#### **Conclusion**
This challenge provides an opportunity for participants to **apply AI and data science skills** to a pressing environmental issue. Winning teams will receive **cash prizes** and an **invitation to an awards celebration**, with the potential for their models to contribute to real-world urban planning solutions.
