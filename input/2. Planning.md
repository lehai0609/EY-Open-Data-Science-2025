Great question! There are several publicly available datasets that could enhance the predictive power of your model. Here are a few suggestions, categorized by how they could help with the Urban Heat Island (UHI) problem:

---

### **Why Use These?**

These datasets provide additional features that can:

- Capture socioeconomic and environmental interactions with urban heat.
- Help identify the root causes of UHI in specific areas.
- Enhance model accuracy and applicability for urban planners.

Do you want to discuss how to integrate one of these datasets, or would you like help finding a specific dataset for your project?

Based on the **2025 EY Open Science AI & Data Challenge** guidelines and referenced scientific literature, here are **scientifically proven factors** that influence the Urban Heat Island (UHI) index, along with actionable insights for modeling these factors using the provided datasets:

---

### **1. Vegetation and Green Space (NDVI)**
- **Scientific Basis**:  
  Vegetation reduces UHI through shading and evapotranspiration. Studies (e.g., Reference 4) show a strong inverse correlation between vegetation density and UHI intensity.  
- **How to Model**:  
  Use **Sentinel-2 multispectral data** to calculate the **Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)**. Areas with low NDVI (e.g., NDVI < 0.3) indicate sparse vegetation and correlate with UHI hotspots.  
- **Action**:  
  Integrate NDVI as a feature in your model to quantify the cooling effect of green spaces.

---

### **2. Building Density and Urban Geometry**
- **Scientific Basis**:  
  High building density traps heat, reduces airflow, and increases waste heat from HVAC systems (Reference 3).  
- **How to Model**:  
  Analyze **building footprint data** to calculate metrics like:  
  - **Floor Area Ratio (FAR)**: Total building area / land area.  
  - **Sky View Factor (SVF)**: Ratio of visible sky to total hemisphere (low SVF = restricted heat dissipation).  
- **Action**:  
  Use spatial clustering (e.g., kernel density) to map building density and correlate with UHI index values.

---

### **3. Surface Materials and Albedo**
- **Scientific Basis**:  
  Materials like asphalt and concrete have low albedo (reflectivity), absorbing and re-radiating heat (Reference 4).  
- **How to Model**:  
  Use **Landsat Land Surface Temperature (LST)** data to identify heat-retaining surfaces (e.g., roads, rooftops).  
  - Calculate **albedo** from Sentinel-2 bands (e.g., Band 2 (Blue) and Band 4 (Red)).  
- **Action**:  
  Combine LST and albedo to identify "heat traps" (e.g., dark pavements) contributing to UHI.

---

### **4. Proximity to Water Bodies**
- **Scientific Basis**:  
  Water bodies moderate temperatures through evaporative cooling.  
- **How to Model**:  
  Use Sentinel-2’s **Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)** to map water bodies. Calculate **distance to water** for each UHI index point.  
- **Action**:  
  Include proximity to water as a feature to assess cooling potential.

---

### **5. Local Weather Conditions**
- **Scientific Basis**:  
  Wind speed enhances heat dispersion, while high humidity exacerbates heat stress (Reference 5).  
- **How to Model**:  
  Use **local weather data** (wind speed, solar flux, humidity) to:  
  - Normalize UHI index values for weather variability.  
  - Identify conditions amplifying UHI (e.g., low wind + high solar flux).  
- **Action**:  
  Train the model with weather variables as dynamic features.

---

### **6. Anthropogenic Heat Emissions**
- **Scientific Basis**:  
  Waste heat from vehicles, industries, and buildings directly raises local temperatures (References 1, 2).  
- **How to Model**:  
  While traffic/energy data is **not provided**, participants can:  
  - Use **building footprints** as a proxy for energy use (e.g., large buildings = higher HVAC emissions).  
  - Infer traffic patterns from public datasets (e.g., NYC Open Data Portal).  
- **Action**:  
  If using external data, ensure it is open-source and properly referenced.

---

### **7. Temporal and Spatial Resolution Mismatch**
- **Challenge**:  
  Landsat LST (June 16) and Sentinel-2 (June–August 2021) do not align temporally with ground data (July 24, 2021).  
- **Solution**:  
  - Use **time-series interpolation** or assume summer stability in vegetation/surface conditions.  
  - Validate with weather data (e.g., July 24 solar flux) to adjust for daily variations.

---

### **Model Integration Strategy**
1. **Feature Engineering**:  
   - Create composite features (e.g., `NDVI × Building Density`) to capture interaction effects.  
   - Normalize features (e.g., scale NDVI and LST to 0–1 range).  
2. **Algorithm Selection**:  
   - Use **Random Forest** or **Gradient Boosting** to handle non-linear relationships (References 4, 5).  
   - Apply **SHAP values** to interpret feature importance (e.g., which factor most impacts UHI).  
3. **Validation**:  
   - Cross-validate using the 70/30 split mentioned in the challenge.  
   - Prioritize **R²** and **RMSE** metrics to evaluate predictive accuracy.
